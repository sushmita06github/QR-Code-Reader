# QR Code Reader

A QR code reader is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The QR code is generated using a QR API that is utilized in JavaScript. 
In this project, an area is provided to upload an image of a QR code, and as soon as the image is uploaded, the reader automatically attempts to read the QR code. 
If anything other than a QR code is uploaded, it wonâ€™t be read. This is designed to be a beginner-friendly and basic project.
